      *Welcome to #{configatron.app_name} #{user[:real_name] || user[:name]} :wave:*

      My name is RBot and I've got a few things to share with you.

      *We don't have many rules, but we do have a few:*

      1. Be kind.
      2. Don't use `@everyone`, `@channel`, `@group` or `@here`.
      3. Don't ask if you can ask a question; just ask.
      4. Don't ask the same question in multiple channels.
      5. Wrap code in backticks. <https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204977928/backticks.png|Example here>.
      6. See #1.

      Be sure to browse all the public channels to see any topics and conversations that might be interesting to you.  We also have private channels for various interests and communities. Here's contact info if you want an invite to the following private channels:
      - #women-in-tech: <@UAS76M3HN>

      If you're new to Ruby and/or Rails checkout <https://github.com/railslink/resources/wiki|our wiki> for resources to get started.

      We're glad to have you here!
