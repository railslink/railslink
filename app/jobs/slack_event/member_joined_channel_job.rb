        Welcome to our job posting channel. This channel is specifically for posting job offers.

        If you are seeking work, please use #job-seekers.

        For all other discussion of jobs, workplaces, career paths, etc. other than job opportunities, please use #job-chat.

        Your job offer should include the location, remote friendliness, company name, as well as instructions on how to apply.

        Be courteous and do not cross-post to other channels or post repeatedly for the same job offer. Do not pin your job post.

        Please use Slack threads to followup to keep the main channel's signal to noise ratio high.

        NOTE: To help keep this channel on topic for the community, we're asking that the job postings be related in some way to ruby or ruby on rails development (this include frontend work as well).  If we don't feel the job aligns with that heuristic we'll be taking down posts without warning.

        Thank you!
