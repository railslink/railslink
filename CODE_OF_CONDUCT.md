# Code of Conduct

_Last Revised: March 23, 2019_

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as admins
and members  pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:**

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

**Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants and admins include:**

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Repeatedly violating the community's documented content posting conventions
* Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission by said person(s)
* Engaging in unprofessional discussions/debates on social media in regards to
  the community
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Admins are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and
are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
instances of unacceptable behavior.

Admins have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, slack messages, and other contributions that
are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban, temporarily or permanently,
any member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within internal community spaces and in
public spaces when an individual is representing the community. Examples of
representing the community include using an official community email address,
posting via an official social media account, acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event, or identifying oneself as a
member of the community. Representation of a project may be further defined and
clarified by admins.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting an admin. To get a list of community admins visit
https://www.rubyonrails.link/admin_members.

**Please include the following information in every report:**

* contact information for the reporter
* names/usernames of all people involved, if known
* when and where it happened
* what happened
* screenshots of the incident, if possible
* any additional context
* is it ongoing?

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The admins are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. 

If you want to report an admin for a violation of the contributor covenant,
please use the /admins command in slack to list admins and then choose one to
DM, or choose a different admin on the contact form on the website.  These
communications will be treated with complete confidentiality and the behavior
will be investigated in accordance with the same process as all other reports.


Admins who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face
temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the
community's leadership.

### Investigation

* Gathering information
* Assessing the impact of the behavior
	* How many people are affected?
	* In public/private?
	* Spill-over effects
* Assessing the risk of further harm
	* Medical/legal requirements
	* Repeat offenders
	* How dangerous is it for this to happen again?
* Determining what resources are needed, if necessary
* Addressing the problem
	* Make the decision you need right now; decide on the long-term response later
* Following up with the people affected
	* We found a CC violation
	* We chose to respond with X
	* (unless banned) If it happens again, X will happen
	* We're here in case you need more support or anything else happens
* Recording the full details and resolution
* Following up within the admin team
	* How did it go?
	* What did we learn?
	* Do we need anything for next time?
	* Is there anything we haven't resolved?
